Hey. I'm Jack Calland. ✌🏼

I am a research economist @J-PAL Africa, working on randomised evaluation projects in the fields of labour and social protection. 👷🏽

My data work is mostly in Stata, sometimes in SQL and Python, and I'm learning R. 👨🏼‍💻

My current personal project is creating a website, hosted by GitHub Pages. 🌵
